# crashme
A nasty experiment in doing horrible things to computers to make them crash.

I'm going to try and get as raw as I can with C and just build a program that will crash the computer, at whatever level possible, that it runs on.
It's not meant to be any kind of proof of concept, security tool or malicious thing, I'm just curious how easy it is with modern operating systems to completely frag a computer.

Oh and don't expect much work done here, it's just a total side project.
